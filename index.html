        <p class="about">
            In the R-land, every day there are some types of events organized by various groups, but there are many times when two or more important events, which are important to a particular group of people, get clashed. It becomes difficult to decide which event
            should be attended.<br><br> So this app provides a common platform to all the groups where they can put their events. As we know that all the groups announce events by posts through their facebook pages. But what problem occurs
            here is that a person from a particular group don't get to know that his/her group's event is going to clash with some others so here from this app the group members can see the upcoming events on a particular date and organize their event
            as when they want. Also in this app students would be able to view all the events on a day in one common display they don't have to search so many groups on facebook and look if there is an event or keep scrolling in their facebook feed. Although,
            facebook app provides a page where we can mark an event as interested in it gives us a reminder on that day. But these days not every event is posted as this page and not everyone uses facebook that much. <br><br> Another feature that makes
            this app different from facebook pages is the review and rating section. The students after the event can give their feedback and rating to a particular event. The feedback will be sent to the particular group only, others will not be able
            to see it, making it private. So the groups would be able to make their upcoming events better according to the feedback of the students.
